**The OWASP SecureTea Project** is an application designed to help Secure a person's laptop or computer / server with IoT (Internet Of Things) for notify users (via various communication mechanisms), whenever someone accesses their computer / server. This application uses the touchpad/mouse/wireless mouse to determine activity and is developed in Python and tested on various machines (Linux, Mac & Windows). 

The purpose of this application is to warn the user (via various communication mechanisms) whenever their computer / server accessed.
This small application was developed and tested in python in Linux machine, macOS & Windows.

## Firewall
SecureTea Firewall currently uses the following rules to filter the incoming traffic:
<br><br>
**Process 1 (Firewall Engine):**
- Filter packets based on:
    - Inbound IP rules
    - Outbound IP rules
    - Source port rules
    - Destination port rules
    - Protocols
    - Scan for downloads in HTTP websites
    - DNS filter rules
    - Filter HTTP request & response
    - IP packet first fragment
    - IP packet fragment boundary
    - IP packet fragment small offset
    - Unknown IP version
    - Invalid IP source
    - Invalid IP header length
    - Network congestion detection
    - Ending FIN-ACK handshakes
    - TCP Packet with None flag
    - SYN fragmentation
    - ICMP fragmentation attack
    - Large ICMP packets
    
 Apart from that, the background process deals with the following functions:
 <br><br>
**Process 2 (Firewall Monitor):**
- Monitor open ports
- Monitor active services
- Monitor network usage
- Monitor active CPU process

## Intrusion Detection System
SecureTea Intrusion Detection System (IDS) deals with the following attack vectors and logs any abnormalities:

**Detect probe (reconnaissance) attacks (performed for information gathering)**

- General scans: TCP ACK & TCP Window, UDP, ICMP scans
- Stealth scans: FIN, XMAS, NULL scans
- OS fingerprinting scans

**Detect Denial of Service (DoS) & Remote to Local (R2L) attacks**
- DoS attacks
- CAM Table Exhaustion
- DHCP Exhaustion
- Man in The Middle (MiTM) / ARP cache poisoning
- SYN flood attack
- Ping of death
- Land attack
- Wireless
     - Deauthentication attack
    - Hidden node attack
    - SSID spoofing
    - Fake access point
   
**Generate report about the malicious IP address using OSINT tools**
The report will contain the following fields:
1. Reverse DNS
2. Geo lookup
3. WHOIS lookup
4. Other important details

## Insecure Headers
Check/monitor the website for the followings:
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - X-Content-Type
  - Strict Transport Security
  - Content Security Policy
  - X-Frame
  - HTTP methods
       - Test all methods - 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS', 'TRACE', 'TEST'
       - Cross Site Tracing vulnerability
- Check for cookie details

## System Log Monitor
System log aggregator to disparate log files, organize the useful data and apply intelligence to detect intrusion activities.

**a. Log file :** `/etc/passwd` & `/etc/shadow`
  - Detect backdoors
  - Detect user existing without a password that may lead to privilege escalation
  - Check integrity of system's password storing
  - Detect non-standard hashing algorithm used in passwords to guess system manipulation

**b. Log file**: `/var/log/auth.log` & `/var/log/faillog`
  - Detect system login attempts
  - Detect password brute-force
  - Detect harmful commands executed as root
  - Detect port scans
  - Detect SSH login attempts & brute-force

**c. Log file:** `/var/log/syslog`
  - Detect malicious sniffer by extracting PROMISC mode

## Server Log Monitor
System log aggregator to disparate server log files, organize the useful data and apply intelligence to detect intrusion activities.

Currently, the server log monitor supports the following log file types:
1. Apache
2. Nginx

The following suspicious activities/attacks can be detected:
- Attacks
   - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
   - Cross site scripting (XSS) injection
   - SQL injection (SQLi)
   - Local file inclusion (LFI)
   - Web shell injection
   
 - Reconnaissance attacks
   - Web crawlers / spiders / bots
   - URL Fuzzing
   - Port scans
   - Bad user agents

- Log bad/suspicious IP (later on picked up by Firewall to block incoming request from that IP)

- User defined rules:
   - Filter based on selected IPs
   - Filter based on response code
## AntiVirus
SecureTea real-time signature & heuristic based antivirus.

The following features are currently supported:

1. **Auto fetch updates**: Smart update mechanism, that keeps track of the last update and resumes update from the last downloaded file. User can configure to **switch off** and **switch on** the auto-update feature.

2. **Real-Time monitoring**: Scan as soon as a file is modified or a new file is added.

3. **Scanner engine**: Scanner engine runs on **3 process**, they are as follows:
   - **Hash** Signature scanner
   - **Yara** Heuristic scanner
   - **Clam AV** Scanner

4. **YARA** rules can detect: 
   - Viruses
   - Worms
   - Ransomware
   - Adware
   - Spyware
   - Rootkits
   - RATs

5. Leveraging the power of **VirusTotal API**: Optional for users, provides an easy option for them to test for specific files against multiple anti-viruses & in a safe sandbox environment, i.e. after a file is detected malicious, the file will be put under VirusTotal test for a final confirmation.

6. Monitor **orphaned files**: Use SUID, SGID and read capabilities in Linux to separate orphaned files and check if any file is granted more capabilities than it should be.

7. Keeps an eye on **USB devices**: Start scanning the USB device as soon as it is plugged in & report for any virus/malware found.

8. Cleaning the found files: Opt for either **auto-delete** or **manual** delete option, in auto-delete the file found malicious is automatically deleted, whereas in manual it requires the confirmation of the user.

9. **Custom** and **Full** scan options

## Web Deface Detection
Monitor server files to detect any changes, roll back to default in case of defacement.

**Features:**
1. Auto locate the server files based on the user choice of server (i.e. Apache, Nginx, etc.) and the operating system detected.

2. Allow user to overwrite the above default auto-located file path and use their custom file path.

3. Scan the directory for files and generate a cache / backup of the files.

4. Generate SHA 256 hashes of each file and use them for comparison.

SecureTea Web Defacement Detection would detect file addition, deletion and modification and roll back to the original file immediately. It would not allow addition of any new files, deletion of files or any type of modification to the current existing files.

## IoT Anonymity Checker

“Shodan is a search engine which collects the information about all IPv4 and IPv6 devices connected to the internet and gives us the ability to search devices using filters that can be very sophisticated.” (source: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/shodan-iot-problem/#gref)

In short, Shodan is a search engine for IoT devices, that can index thousands of IoT devices connected to the internet. At times, this can be great for hackers trying to gain access to the device. As a security feature, it would be good to stay out of Shodan search radar. It will good to check whether the IoT device is under the Shodan grid or not, if
yes, immediate action needs to be taken or else we are all fine!
